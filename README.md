# AutoRobot-HomePatrol
Project to build a toy robot indoor patrol car that runs autonomously.

**Parts list**:
1. Arduino Uno board
2. 2 Wheels robot car body kit (available for cheap in most electronics stores)
3. Trolley wheel
4. 100 RPM geared DC BO-motor 
5. DC motor driver - L293D shield board
6. Ultrasonic range finding sensor - HC-SR04
7. YL-44 active Buzzer
8. LEDs Bright Blue -2, Bright Red -2
9. USB battery pack for power supply
10. Micro Servo Motor - SG90 
11. Tools: Screwdriver, Hot glue gun, wire tags

This is a DIY fully autonomous toy car that can move around indoors on its own, avoiding obstacles. Sense of surroundings is achieved by the SR-HC04 ultrasonic SONAR range sensor mounted on a servo motor that sweeps left to right and measures distance constantly in steps. 

Heart of the unit is the Arduino UNO board with a L293D shield mounted on top as it provides a very cheap, easy and integrated solution to drive the DC BO motors along with the Servo motor.
